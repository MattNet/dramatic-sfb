<a name='introduction'></a>
<p><div class='bigdark'>INTRODUCTION</div>

<p>Many campaigns revolve around empires that are seeking to raise themselves to greatness, usually at the expense of their neighbors. They may do this in a "4X" (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) style, with varying amounts of detail and paperwork. They may use an SFU published campaign, such as the Admiral's Campaign (U3.0). Or they may use something akin to 'Federation and Empire' (F&E). Usually anything published is tweaked to the individual tastes of the players involved.

<p>This is not that sort of campaign.

<p>This campaign focuses not on the goals of the heads of state or the admirals, but on the captains. Instead of fighting a war, with territory marked out in controlled sectors and colonies of varying levels of productivity, the campaign is the storyboard of a television series. Anytime there is an odd subspace anomaly or dangerous space monster, you can always assume that both parties will show up to investigate at the same time. Should one party attack another, we focus on where each side has a chance of victory.

<a name='summary'></a>
<p><div class='lighthead'>SUMMARY</div>

<p>This campaign moves the focus away from research and development. To that aim, there is no map. Each player has a border who's size fluctuates as the game moves forward. Encounters are drawn randomly, the number of which matches the size of the border. Ships are bid to each encounter and those encounters which wildly favor one side or another are resolved automatically. Benefits and penalties, such as an increase in income or a reduction in border size, are assigned depending on the outcome of each encounter.


<a name='sequence of play'></a>
<p><div class='bigdark'>SEQUENCE OF PLAY</div>

<p>Setup: (At start of campaign)
<p>Collect Resource Points:
<br>&bull; The stockpile of EPs for each player grows by the amount of their income
<p>Construction:
<br>&bull; Ships are repaired, built, converted, or refit, per the previous turn's orders
<p>Draw Encounters:
<br>&bull; Each empire draws one encounter for each unit of size of their border with another empire. Both empires share this encounter.
<br>&bull; The defender and attacker of this encounter is randomly determined
<p>Place Bids:
<br>&bull; Each player secretly bids their ships to each encounter
<p>Play Encounters:
<br>&bull; Ship assignments are revealed
<br>&bull; Encounters which have "overwhelming force" are automatically marked as such
<br>&bull; The players play the remaining encounters
<p>Encounters are Reported:
<br>&bull; The players report victory or defeat for each encounter
<br>&bull; The players mark those ships that were crippled or destroyed
<p>Encounter Resolution:
<br>&bull; Ships are actually crippled or destroyed
<br>&bull; The encounter rewards or penalties are applied
<p>The turn is completed and a new one begins

<a name='setup'></a>
<p><div class='bigdark'>SETUP</div>

<p>The campaign is heavily computer moderated. Should there be an error in the software, contact the campaign administrator to get the problem resolved.

<p>The modules used in this campaign are: Basic, Advanced, C1-C3, C6, F1, F2, J, J2, K, M, R1-R6, R8, R10, and Y1. Only the units in these modules are available. Ships found in Captain's Logs, Starletter, the ADB BBS, or player-made units are not allowed.

<a name='available empires'></a>
<p><div class='lighthead'>AVAILABLE EMPIRES</div>

<p>Except where the campaign starting year makes the empire unusable, these are the allowed empires to pick from: Federation (R2.0), Klingon (R3.0), Romulan (R4.0), Kzinti (R5.0), Gorn (R6.0), Tholian (R7.0), Hydran (R9.0), Andromedan (R10.0), Lyran (R11.0), ISC (R13.0), Seltorian (R15.0), Jindarian (R16.0), Vudar (R17.0), Paravian (R18.0), Carnivon (R19.0), and Frax (R51.0). Missing from this list are the Orions (R8.0) and LDR (R12.0), who are not available for play.

<a name='empire rules'></a>
<p><div class='bigdark'>SPECIAL EMPIRE RULES</div>

<p>The various encounters assume that the empires mostly have the same kinds of units, or have the same sort of operational mindset. This works for most of the empires out there, but not everyone works the same way in every situation. The following attempts to address those questions that might arise on how to handle oddball situations.

<p><b>FEDERATION</b>
<br><i>Third Way:</i> The Federation has the option of picking the non-Third-Way empire, who can instead fly PFs, when they join the campaign. The build-able ships change, in that they cannot produce F-111s but instead are allowed PFs, PFTs, and the mech-link refit. They may not use the "Command & Control" advantage seen by the (S8.327) rule. Additional "Third Way" rules that the PF Feds can no longer use include additional Megapacked fighters (S8.3285) and Carrier Battle Group (S8.283) rules.

<p><b>ROMULAN</b>
<br><i>Tugs:</i> The Freight Eagle (R4.30) is always considered a non-combat tug. The SPH (R4.31) is always considered a combat tug. The KRT (R4.33) is considered a combat tug until after the two-year introduction date for the SPH (so, after Y170), at which point the KRT is considered a non-combat tug. When a scenario forces the Romulan to use a combat/non-combat tug and there are two tugs that qualify, then the Romulan may choose which tug to use of those that qualify before their opponent places their units on the map.

<p><b>THOLIAN</b>
<br>The Tholains are always considered to be in the holdfast for purposes of (S8.223)
<br><i>Tugs:</i> The CPC is always a non-combat tug. At the appropriate year of service, the LTT can be used as a non-combat tug.

<p><b>WYN</b>
<br>The WYN are always considered to be in the cluster for purposes of (S8.222)
<br>Note that the systems that fill option-mounts are paid for from the commander's options points (G15.42), which includes drone speed upgrades. Additionally, note the weapon percentages of (G15.442).
<br><i>Tugs:</i> Use a F-AL (disruptor) with a pair of General Skids. Pods present in the scenario (if any) replace the cargo pods on the freighter. Assume the freighter can attach pods by (G14.4) and disengage pods by (G14.3).
<br>The WYN may use Klingon, Lyran, and Kzinti Interceptors, PFs, and Fighters interchangebly on their ships. Some or all of the attrition units may be replaced before the scenario is set up by spending commander's option points to pay for the difference in cost between what is given and what is wanted. Note that "rare" models (such as the Kzinti MRN or disruptor-armed assault fighters) may not be used in this fashion.

<p><b>ANDROMEDAN</b>
<br><i>Tugs:</i> Use a Queen Snake (R10.22) for an Andromedan Tug (even if the YIS does not match). Assume the Queen Snake can dock one pod (using (G14.3) and (G14.4) ) and that the pod increases the movement cost to 1.
<br><i>Cargo Pods:</i> Use P-CMs
<br><i>Civilian Bases (SAMs, CPLs, or CPPs):</i> Use a MOS (R10.62). If the base had fighters (such as the scenario states there is an attached HBM) then allow the MOS to have it's MWPs. Otherwise it is without the MWPs. This can create a situation where the "base" is mobile. The MOS will always start the scenario at speed 0, though may be in orbit if the scenario so states.
<br><i>FRDs:</i> Use a Lyran FRD with DisDevs replacing ESGs. (Yes. This means an Andromedan unit is using shields instead of PA panels, with all of the advantages and disadvantages of them). Use Andromedan batteries.
<br><i>Freighters:</i> Use a CS (R10.36) as a substitution for a F-S. Use a pair of CSs as a substitution for a single F-L. Use four CSs as a substitution for an F-OL.
<br><i>Q-Ships:</i> In scenarios where there is an Andromedan "Q-Ship", use a single GUN that has concealment panels (D17.74) across the applicable phasers to make it appear as a CS. Due the warp power and maneuver statistics of both ships being identical, as a special rule this unit cannot be distinguished from a CS until the weapon's panels are blown clear under (D17.742). Note that those scenarios where a large Q-Ship replaces a large freighter, one or two of these GUNs may replace the large freighter.
<br><i>Skiffs:</i> Use an MCP (R10.49)

<p><b>JINDARIAN</b>
<br>The Jindarians are always considered "In Transit" for purposes of (R16.1F). Thus, they are always under the <a href='#command limits'>command limit rules</a> of the campaign, like the other empires. This includes the few instances where the scenario takes place in an asteroid field.
<br><i>Tugs:</i> Use a CLT as a tug. Assume for purposes of the scenarios with pods, that the CLT can dock one pod and that it increases the CLT's move cost to 3/4.
<br><i>Cargo Pods:</i> Use P-CCs
<br><i>Civilian Bases (SAMs, CPLs, or CPPs):</i> Use the Federation SSDs for the base in question. Use LRGs (E18.6) for the heavy weapons.
<br><i>Larger Bases (MB, BS, BSC, BATS):</i> Use Federation SSDs for the base in question. MRGs (E18.73) replace Photons and LRGs (E18.6) replace Drones.
<br><i>Ground Bases:</i> Use the standard SSDs for the base in question.
<br><i>FRDs:</i> Use the Federation FRD, but with LRGs replacing the drone racks.
<br><i>Freighters:</i> Use regular freighters, as stated in the scenario.
<br><i>Skiffs:</i> Use regular skiffs.
<br><i>Commander's Option Points:</i> Jindarians may purchase asteroids out of commanders option points, using the costs given in Annex #6A for web anchors (e.g. 25 pts). These asteroids are placed in the starting hex(s) of the Jindarians, moving at speed 0 or speed 1 (at the Jindarians choice.)
<br>If one or two asteroids are purchased, then they may serve as decoy asteroids. Asteroid ships may use Hidden Deployment (R16.1C6) if they start in the same hex, with the same speed, and the same heading as the asteroid. The ship(s) may not use warp power for movement or raise shields while so disguised. In this case, the asteroid ship is on the map, but the opponent does not know which is the asteroid ship until the ship is revealed (e.g. any fire or seekers directed at the asteroid/ship that has not been revealed must be announced as to which asteroid is being targeted when resolved.)
<br>If three or more asteroids are purchased and placed within two hexes from furthest to furthest, then the 7 hexes of circular area that encloses all those asteroids is considered an asteroid field area for the purposes of (P2.2), (P2.3), (R16.1C6), and (R16.1D).

<a name='camapaign end'></a>
<p><div class='bigdark'>ENDING THE CAMPAIGN</div>

<p>The campaign ends when there is one player remaining or by agreement from the remaining players.  Players are removed from the campaign when all of their borders are reduced to 0. They are then no longer in contact with anyone.

<a name='economy'></a>
<p><div class='bigdark'>ECONOMY</div>

<p>An empire's economic income is boiled down to a single number. This represents the myriad of colony planets and various taxes from trade routes that happen "off screen". This is then stockpiled in the Imperial Treasury. From there construction, repairs, and refits are paid for.

<p>There is no maintenance costs for your fleet. This is handled transparently by the legion of bureaucrats inherent in such a large organization as each empire. Likewise, there is no need to pay for supplies (drones, et. al.), odd shipboard equipment (Commanders Options) or the replacement of attrition units (fighters, PFs, etc..)

<a name='ship construction'></a>
<p><div class='bigdark'>SHIP CONSTRUCTION</div>

<p>Ships are constructed at the start of the following turn. Once completed, they are immediately placed in the pool of available units for bidding to encounters.

<p>The price of many units include various things that are inherent to the ship that are not normally reflected in the ship's cost in the source material. This includes the cost of faster drones and the cost of fighters. Do not be alarmed when carriers seem excessively expensive; it means the cost of the fighters is already calculated and included.

<a name='attrition units'></a>
<p><div class='lighthead'>ATTRITION UNITS</div>

<p>Carriers require escorts. Any carrier that is insufficiently escorted must retreat when confronted by an opposing force. However, we are using the "Flexible Carrier Escorts" rule of (S8.315).

<p>The cost to purchase attrition units (Fighters and PFs) is included in the cost of the carrying ship. This does mean that an upgrade in the attrition units is treated like a refit. However, there is no cost to replace the attrition units if they are destroyed and the ship does not need to be held back from the bidding to have their attrition units replenished.

<p>If the player wishes to change the type of PF or fighter being used at the start of a scenario, use the Commander's Options available to the attrition unit being replaced to pay for the difference (if the replacement is more expensive). This cannot be done if the unit did not normally operate (per the Section R description) from the ship performing the replacement (e.g. MRNs for non-SCSs, F-14s for nearly any ship, and so on.) In the case of Hydran casual fighters (R9.R6), the costs come from the Commander's Options of the ship. The pool of commander's options is not made larger if the new PF is more expensive. (e.g. the commander's options pool is not recalculated)
<br><i>For example:</i> Exchanging a Tholian Arachnid PF for an Arachnid-W (the snare-generator variant) can be done without cost, because they are the same BPV. Exchanging a Kzinti PF-N (a standard Needler) for a PF-D (the drone variant) can be done by spending 4 (or 6) of that PF's Commander's Options to pay for the difference in cost and also to upgrade the third drone rack to the same speed as the rest of the PF.

<p>Heavy fighters may replace a pair of fighters (must be the same type of fighter). The difference in cost between the fighters and the heavy fighter (if the heavy fighter, with drone speed upgrades, is more expensive) must be paid from that carrier's commander's option points. (This is treated the same situation as mentioned above with PFs.) Note that only true carriers, not the Hydran hybrid carriers (see (R9.N1) ), can carry heavy fighters. Also note that ships carrying PFs, even via the Mech Link Refit (R1.R1), cannot carry heavy fighters (J10.0).
<br><i>Example:</i> A Hydran Uhlan decides to trade in all 16 of their fighters for 8 Stinger-Ss. That is 160 BPV worth of fighters, trading in for 136 BPV worth of double-space fighters. The swap is made with no cost and no rebate for the Uhlan.
<br><i>Example:</i> A Tholian Black Widow decides to trade in all 8 of their fighters (an equal mix of Spider-IIs and Spider-IIIs) for 4 Spider-Vs. That is 60 BPV worth of fighters, trading in for 76 BPV worth of double-space fighters. The carrier was given 13 Commander's Option points and the original fighters generated another 12 points. The Black Widow must spend 16 of those 25 points to upgrade the fighters.

<p>Likewise, Megafighter packs may be purchased for some or all of the fighters from the Commander's Option Points allowed for the carrier.

<p>See also <a href='#independent strikes'>Independent Strikes</a>

<a name='repair'></a>
<p><div class='lighthead'>REPAIR</div>

<p>Individual damage to ships is not tracked. For purposes of the campaign, the simple case of whether or not the unit is crippled (S2.4) is all that is tracked.

<p>If a ship is marked as crippled and then shows up in an encounter, then score 60% of the ships internals as a single volley before the encounter begins.

<p>To repair a ship, give it orders to be repaired. It cannot then be bid to an encounter for that turn. On the following turn, it will be repaired.

<a href='gifts'></a>
<p><div class='lighthead'>GIFTS</div>

<p>Ships may be gifted to other empires. An order must be given to gift the unit, and then it will be available to the new empire on the following turn.

<p>This mechanic is also how a transfer of ownership occurs if the ship were captured during combat.

<a href='technology advancement'></a>
<p><div class='bigdark'>TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT</div>

<p>Units become available per the Year In Service (YIS) dates given for the units in the source material. Each campaign has it's own rate in which time passes (though 2 turns per year is common).

<a name='refits'></a>
<p><div class='lighthead'>REFITS</div>

<p>Like repairs, sending a ship in to be refit will mean it is unavailable until the next turn.

<a name='conversions'></a>
<p><div class='lighthead'>CONVERSIONS</div>

<p>Like repairs and refits, sending a ship in to be converted will mean it is unavailable until the next turn.

<a name='movement'></a>
<p><div class='bigdark'>MOVEMENT</div>

<p>Because there is no map, there is not a movement system. Ships come from a pool when entering an encounter, and return to that pool when finished.

<a name='bidding'></a>
<p><div class='lighthead'>BIDDING</div>

<p>Ships are secretly bid to each encounter at the start of the turn. Ships that are being built or under repairs, refits, or conversions, cannot participate in the bidding process.
<br>After everyone is ready, all bids are revealed. Encounters that have no units from either side bid to them, are dropped and not resolved. Bids that are marked as "Overwhelming Force" are a victory for the empire who supplied overwhelming force.

<a name='combat'></a>
<p><div class='bigdark'>COMBAT</div>

<p>Combat is held by the SFB system. Players are expected to talk out or otherwise quickly resolve battles where overwhelming force is determined, but they do not need to resolve the battle under the full SFB system. (They may, for example, agree that the defenders retreat without incident, or they may dig out F&E and use the SIDCORS system (<a href='http://sfb.mattnet.org/sidcors_extract.html'>an old extract here</a>) to quickly determine which ships are crippled before the defender retires)

<p>Each encounter includes information on where to place the forces and how large a map to use. They also include the conditions in which to determine the winner (usually by using the victory conditions in (S2.2).) Do note that the stalemate conditions in (S2.27) are also in effect. Also note that it is assumed that the first player noted in the scenario description is marked as the defender, and it is assumed that they are to set up first.

<a name='command limits'></a>
<p><div class='lighthead'>COMMAND LIMITS</div>

<p>When each encounter is ready to be resolved, it is up to the players to form legal fleets before placing units on the map. Players are expected to adhere to the rules in (S8.0) when forming legal fleets to play through an encounter, though any collection of units may be bid to an encounter.

<p>At this time, the only system used by this campaign to limit the size of fleets is the Command Rating (CR) system as expressed in (S8.0). We are not using the Fleet Combat Rating (FCR) system from the Campaign Designer's Handbook or the BPV Capacity (BPV Cap) system from <a href='http://sfb.mattnet.org/another_glory/another_glory.html#command limits'>the <i>Another Way to Glory</i> campaign</a>.

<p>Note that there are some scenarios that allow one player or another some extra units for purposes of that one scenario. If that player does not bid to that scenario a ship that has a command rating equal to or in excess of that required to command those units, they automatically lose this scenario by virtue of not having a mobile unit present. (The other player simply destroys those units over the course of several turns in a manner where they take the least internal damage to themselves.)

<a name='other fleet restrictions'></a>
<p><div class='lighthead'>OTHER FLEET RESTRICTIONS</div>

<p>Keep in mind the restrictions on special weapons, such as Displacement Devices (G18.8), PPDs (E11.17), and Web Casters (E12.16)

<a name='independent strikes'></a>
<p><div class='lighthead'>INDEPENDENT STRIKES</div>

<p>There are no "Independent Strikes" of attrition units. If a flight of attrition units is to be used in a battle, then the carrying unit (carrier or PFT) must also be included.

<a name='ground assault'></a>
<p><div class='lighthead'>GROUND ASSAULT</div>

<p>In those cases where a scenario has the potential for ground combat, the Ground combat rules from module M (D15.0) will be used. 

<a name='captured units'></a>
<p><div class='lighthead'>CAPTURED UNITS</div>

<p>Units may be captured by another power during an encounter. To accurately reflect this in the campaign, the original owner must give orders that the captured unit be gifted to the capturing power. The unit will have changed ownership by the following turn.

<a name='sfb rules'></a>
<p><div class='lighthead'>SFB RULES</div>

<p>The following are the SFB rules that are being used in combats:
<br>&bull;&nbsp; Secret Placement of Mines (M2.6)
<br>&bull;&nbsp; All Electronic Warfare (D3.6) - including Self Generated, Scout Channels, Natural EW, and Small Target Modifier
<br>&bull;&nbsp; Stalemate (S2.27)
<br>&bull;&nbsp; Directed Turn Modes (maulers only) (C3.8)
<br>&bull;&nbsp; Flexible Carrier Escorts (S8.315).

<p>The following SFB rules are not being used in combats:
<br>&bull;&nbsp; Positron Flywheel (C9.0)
<br>&bull;&nbsp; Pre-laid Minefields (Except where specified in the scenario text) (M6.0)
<br>&bull;&nbsp; Hidden Cloak (G13.61)
<br>&bull;&nbsp; Tactical Intelligence (D17.0) except for Q-Ships (R1.7B).

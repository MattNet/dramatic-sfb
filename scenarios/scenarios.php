Each Banshee is moved one at a time (because of condition #3 and #4), but all such movement is simultaneous.<br>Establish an order for the Banshees at the start of the scenario, and always move the Banshees in the same order. Step #3 can cause Banshees to fire their venom; if several Banshees try to enter the same hex and/or fire, these will be resolved one at a time, and if the target is destroyed, other Banshees (moving later in the same impulse) will be treated as if that target was not present.<br>1. If a Banshee is within 4 hexes of an armed mobile unit (see definition below), it will attempt to evade that unit (C1.3223). While doing so, it will not violate condition #3 below unless it is impossible to avoid doing so. If a Banshee is within 4 hexes of multiple AMUs, it will select the hex which is more than 4 hexes from the maximum number of AMUs currently within 5 hexes. If no such hex exists, select the hex which is more than 3 hexes from the maximum number of AMUs currently within 5 hexes (or 2, or 1 hexes from such units). If two or more such hexes exist, select the one closest to the target (condition #2). If two or more of those hexes exist, select either unless condition #4 forces one to be selected over the other.<br>2. If condition #1 does not apply, a Banshee will attempt to move toward the BS as a seeking weapon.<br>3. While performing #2, a Banshee will not voluntarily enter a hex within 4 hexes of an armed mobile unit. (It might be forced to do so by turn modes, multiple ships, etc.) For example, if a ship was in the base hex, the Banshee would turn away and maintain range 5 (firing at the ship). If no possible hex is available which does not violate this condition, this condition does not apply and is ignored.<br>Note that this step can trigger firing by the Banshee.<br>4. While performing #1 or #2, and if #3 does not apply, a Banshee will not enter a hex containing another Banshee if another hex is equally acceptable under the seeking weapon rules. A Banshee will not enter a hex containing six other Banshees unless it is absolutely impossible not to do so within the rules (excepting the seeking rules).<br><b>ARMED MOBILE UNIT (AMU):</b> Any unit capable of movement and armed with two direct-fire weapons not counting ADDs and phaser-3s. Phaser-Gs and plasma torpedoes/racks are DF weapons for this purpose. As ships become damaged, they may no longer qualify as armed mobile units. The arming status of the weapons is not relevant. Uncrippled fighters, interceptors, and PFs are always considered armed mobile units, regardless of the state or type of weapons.<br><b>BREEDING:</b> The objective of the Banshees is to breed. Banshees can only breed while inside something (they were originally born in caves in asteroids) but while in a hard vacuum and no gravity.<br>When a Banshee reaches the base (or other target), it will immediately cause 50 damage points (scored as the impact of a seeking weapon) and then die (i.e., is removed from play). If several Banshees arrive simultaneously, they resolve damage one at a time. If the base is destroyed by a given Banshee, others that arrived at the same time but were resolved later will breed. The Banshee which actually destroyed the base cannot breed regardless of the amount of damage it actually used in destroying the base.<br>When the base is 'destroyed', it does not explode; it has simply been reduced to a hollow lifeless hulk that the Banshees can use for breeding purposes. Breeding is instantaneous with the arrival of the next Banshee and releases 72 additional Banshees (total, not for each breeding Banshee) and ends the scenario. All surviving (and newborn) Banshees then organize themselves into one or more hordes and go seek some other target.<br>The player CANNOT destroy his own target unit (base, freighter. etc.) since the wreckage left to the Banshees will be used for breeding.<br>An armed mobile unit size 4 or larger which loses enough weapons or power to no longer qualify as such will be considered a valid breeding target by the Banshees. Banshees cannot breed in PF hulks, which made PFs the defense of choice against this threat.<br><b>VICTORY CONDITIONS:</b> If the Banshees are destroyed and the base survives, the %1\$s player is victorious. If the Banshees succeed in breeding, or the base is destroyed, the %1\$s player loses the scenario.",

A 'point' of crystals in this scenario is equal to seven points of cargo, which must all be recovered at one time by one unit, i.e., two two-seat fighters cannot recover a point by combining their cargo capacity (G25.134).<br>Each transporter can recover one point of crystals per use (G25.211); each shuttle can recover two points [ (G25.131) and (G25.132) ]. An HTS could recover seven (G25.133) ] if it lands on the asteroid and returns to its ship (or a ship of an allied fleet, but in that case the points will belong to the ship, not the shuttle). There are 150 points of crystals on the asteroid. A shuttle must spend 16 consecutive impulses on the asteroid for each point of crystals it loads, up to its allowed capacity.

Only Size-Class 4 or larger units may recover canisters. The shuttle box the canisters are recovered into must first be empty because of the canister's size and shape does not allow for overcrowding (J1.64). It takes a single deck crew action (note that most ships have at least two deck crews, per (J4.814) ) to analyze a canister. Upon being analyzed, the canister 'opens' and changes the ship; roll two dice and consult the following table. The result takes effect during the SHUTTLE & PF FUNCTIONS STAGE (6B8) of the impulse and lasts for as long as is noted in the description (or through the remainder of the scenario; whichever happes first), but does not affect the ship after the end of the scenario (the force creating the effect breaks down within a few hours). The canister may then be moved from the shuttle box to ship's stores with a further deck crew action, leaving the box available to accept a shuttlecraft or another canister. Two deck crews may work on a single canister during any period. If the shuttle box containing a canister is destroyed, the deck crews are killed (as normal) but the canister remains there until moved by deck crew actions (J1.59). Andromedans may only use the same procedure as galactic ships (J1.621) to recover canisters (the canister enters through the some appropriate hatch.) Andromedans who take on a canister has it deposited in a hanger space (Canisters take the 1/4 the space of a Cobra.) If the Andromedan unit does not have any hangers (e.g. Sat Ship), then it may only take on one canister at a time. A canister can be put in stasis, displaced, and tractored, but not death-dragged.

This can increase those values greater than 6 and less than 0. See (G22.712) for the effect on scanners. Apply this modifier to every box of the Sensor and Scanner track for this ship.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>SHIELD GENERATOR: The ship gains the effect of 3 additional reinforcement to each shield or PA bank. This affects every volley for the rest of the game. The shield or PA bank must be up to gain this.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>ENGINEERING NANITES: The ship gains a Legendary Chief Engineer.

It does not degrade (P9.42). Any units (except for the unit that opened the canister) in that hex when the gravity wave is created are immediately affected by the gravity wave on that impulse. Note that the ship that started the gravity wave is affected by it if after the impulse the wave was generated.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>SUBSPACE WARP BUBBLE ENCHANCEMENT: The ship gains nimble (C11.0) status.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>SALVAGE NANOFACTORY: At the end of the Self Destruction Phase of every turn, score 5 (non-directional) internals on the ship. Should the ship survive the scenario (or disengage before destruction), add 0.5 victory points to the player that controlled the ship at the end of the scenario for every turn that this damage occurs.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>THE LOVE BOAT: For the next 32 impulses, all non-canister units will move closer to the ship as if the ship were a black hole (P4.1) on the indicated impulses based on their range to that ship. There is no additional effect once they are in the same hex as the ship (e.g. no ramming, no destruction).</td></tr></table><br><b>VICTORY CONDITIONS</b> For each canister that was picked up by a ship that was not destroyed (but may have disengaged), give a victory point to the player controlling that ship at the end of the scenario.

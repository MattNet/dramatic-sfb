         "<br><b>INITIAL SET UP</b><br><b>%1\$s:</b> %3\$s in 0101, heading C, speed max, WS-II.<br><b>%2\$s:</b> %4\$s in 4030, heading F, speed max, WS-II.<br><b>MONSTER:</b> Place in 2215, heading F, speed max. Use the chart in (U2.11) to select a monster. Replace the <i>Space Amoeba</i> with <i>Boar Hunt</i> (SM18.0 from Module Y1). Replace the <i>Cosmic Cloud</i> with <i>Banshees!</i> (SM13.0 from Module K). The monster's target, instead of a base or planet, is the largest-BPV %1\$s ship (including the cost of attrition units and drones). If it successfully attacks a ship (not a shuttle, fighter, or PF), that unit becomes the monster's target. If the monster can be adjusted for ship size, use the largest-BPV %1\$s ship (including the cost of attrition units and drones). The number of banshees is equal to 1/10th the BPV of the largest-BPV %1\$s ship.<br><b>LENGTH OF SCENARIO:</b> The scenario continues until all forces belonging to one side have been destroyed, captured, or have disengaged.<br><b>SPECIAL RULES</b><br><b>MAP:</b> Use a floating map. Player A's units can disengage from the 01xx and xx01 map edges. Player B's units can disengage only from the 42xx or xx30 map edges. Any units which disengages in an unauthorized direction is considered destroyed.<br><b>SHUTTLES AND PFs:</b>  All shuttles and PFs have warp booster packs if the year selected allows them. Shuttles are advanced types if the year selected allows their use.<br>MRS shuttles may be purchased [up to the limits in (J8.5) ].<br>If using EW fighters, one fighter in each squadron may be of this type.<br><b>COMMANDER'S OPTION ITEMS</b><br>Each ship can purchase additional or special equipment as Commander's Option Items (e.g., T-bombs, extra marines, etc.) up to 20%% of its Combat BPV. See (S3.2) for details and exceptions. Note that whatever is spent here counts in the victory conditions (S2.2) as victory points for the enemy.<br>All drone speeds and types are available, subject only to the year selected for the scenario.<br>Each drone-armed ship can purchase special drones up to the historical racial percentages as part of the Commander's Option Items. Note that (S3.2) allows drone ships extra points for this purpose.<br>Prime Teams (G32.0) are not available in this scenario.<br><b>RESEARCH:</b> Players accumulate research points as per (G4.1) in addition to attacking the monster itself and the enemy starship.<br><b>SOLUTION:</b> When a player accumulates 200 points of information, he may consult chart (S6.1) to determine how he can destroy the monster. (This chart is used no matter which monster is involved, including all banshees on the map. If a '3' (destroyed after 200 damage) is rolled for Banshees, then each banshee of the swarm is killed after 12 damage.) Result #6 is changed to read 'The monster cannot be destroyed'<br>This chart is not consulted by die roll, but by drawing one die-cut counter from six upside-down and shuffled counters which are numbered '1' through (Players may make such a set from blank counters or use six of the 'drone' counters.) The first player to reach this information level picks one of the counters and then places it (after noting the number) upside down in any convenient place. When the other player has accumulated this level of information, he may see the counter previously picked. (This insures that both players discover the same 'only way' to kill the monster.) <br>If the 'need more info' result is picked, go ahead and place it face down (as if it were the real answer). When the second player reaches the information level and finds this counter (or when the first player reaches the amount needed for another attempt), reshuffle all six counters and draw again.<br>If playing SFB online, it is sufficient for one player to roll in a fashion that the other cannot see the result, then create a marker in order to note the resulting number (an Andromedan DisDev marker is convenient. use the target hex as the die-roll.) Reveal the marker's information when the other player reaches the appropriate research level.<br>If the ship controlling the monster is destroyed, the owning player can maintain control of the monster from a shuttlecraft (if one of his is on the mapsheet). If his ship and all shuttles are destroyed, the monster returns to its randomly wandering nature.<br><b>COMMUNICATIONS:</b> At the start of any turn after accumulating 200 points of information, either player (or both if they both have that much information) may roll a die in an attempt to establish communication with the monster.<br>This die roll is increased by one for every 20 points (or any fraction thereof) of damage scored on the monster by that player. It is decreased by one for every 25 points of 'information' in excess of 200 accumulated by that player. If the adjusted die roll is equal to or less than '1, ' the player has established communication with the monster.<br>Should both players establish such communication during the same turn, neither player has communication and they must roll again on the next turn.<br>Should either player disengage or be destroyed, the scenario is over and further communication die rolls are not made.<br>Successful communication by one player blocks the other player from attempting to gain communication.<br><b>CONTROL:</b> Upon establishing communication with the monster, a player controls it. Within its own rules, the player will direct where the monster is to go and when it is to attack.<br>Exception: The Mind Monster (SM6.0) 'attack' because of the nature of their beings. They cannot decline to attack a ship subject to attack under their rules. A player controlling such a monster is effectively limited to moving the monster in such a way as to keep his own ship outside of its lethal radius and to try to get the enemy ship inside that radius. (The Space Amoeba (SM2.0) and Cosmic Cloud (SM4.0) have been replaced by others).<br>The Moral Eel (SM3.0), Sun Snake (SM5.0), Planet Crusher (SM1.0), Banshees (SM13.0), and Space Boars (SM18.0) can all move and fire weapons as if they were a ship (within their own specific rules on movement and combat).<br><b>VICTORY CONDITIONS:</b> Use the Modified Victory Conditions (S2.201), but neither player gets any points for killing the monster.",

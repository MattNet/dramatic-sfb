# Star Fleet Battles Dramatic Campaign
This is the website software needed to run a campaign for [Star Fleet Battles](http:www.starfleetgames.com "Amarillo Design Board website"). The website running [the live version](http://sfbdrama.mattnet.org) has been doing so since Spring of 2015. There is [a short commercial](http://sfbdrama.mattnet.org/commercial.webm "Webm format") that has some website screen-shots in the last half.
## Game Data
The data files are intentionally shortened from what is used in the live-game. There is enough data to run a game, but it will not be a particularly fulfilling one.
